# 2. Using Objects

## 2.1 Objects: Instances of Classes

### 1. Objects
- Structures contain a **state** and **behaviour**
- ***State***: information
- ***Behaviour***: action can be performed

### 2. Classes
- Templates used for creating objects. e.g.

  ```
  public class Student
  {
  }
  ```

### 3. Classes vs. Objects
- An object is an instance of a class


## 2.2 Creating and Storing Objects (Instantiation)

### 1. Parts of a Class
- ***Instance Variables***: hold the state of the object, typically private. e.g.

  ```
  public class Student
  {
      private int grade;
  }
  ```
  
- ***Constructor***: instantiate an object. e.g.

  ```
  public class Student
  {
      private int grade;

      public Student(sGrade)
      {
          grade = sGrade;
      }
  }
  ```

- ***Methods***: Behaviours of the object. e.g.

  ```
  public class Student
  {
      private int grade;

      public Student(sGrade)
      {
          grade = sGrade;
      }

      public String s()
      {
          return "Grade " + grade + " Student";
      }
  }
  ```
