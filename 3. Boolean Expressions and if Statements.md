# 3. Boolean Expressions and if Statements

## 3.1 Boolean Expressions
### 1. Boolean
- A value that is true or false. e.g.
  ```
  boolean loggedIn = false;
  ```

### 2. Comparison Operators
- | Operator | Usage |
  | -------- | ----- |
  | > |	Greater Than |
  | <	| Less Than |
  | >= | Greater Than Or Equal To |
  | <= |Less Than Or Equal To |
  | == | Equal To |
  | != |Not Equal To |


## 3.2 if Statements and Control Flow
### 1. if Statement
- A conditional statement that can be used to alter the flow of a program. e.g.
  
  ```
  if (boolean expression)
  {
      // Segment of code that will run if the boolean expression is true
  }
  ```
  
- if statements by themselves are known as a one-way selection.


## 3.3 if-else Statements
### 1. else Statements
- Using an else statement allows for a two-way selection.
  
  ```
  if (boolean expression) {
      // Segment of code that will run if the boolean expression is true
  }
  else {
      // Segment of code that will run if the boolean expression is false
  }
  ```
